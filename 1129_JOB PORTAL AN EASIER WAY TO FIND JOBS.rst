6.	About (Short Description / Summary): One of the great promises of Android mobile phones is their ability to run applications that enhance opportunities for social networking between users. This promise echoes the reality of the Internet. The first generation of Internet applications was about user access to information, and many of those applications have been very popular. The second wave of Internet applications has been about connecting users to each other. Applications such as Facebook, YouTube, and many others enhance our ability to connect with people of similar interests, and allow the application's users to provide some or all of the content that makes the application what it is. Android has the potential to take that concept and add a new dimension: mobility. It's expected that a whole new generation of applications will be built for users of mobile devices: 
-	Social networking applications that are easy to use while walking down the street
-	 Applications that are aware of the user's location
-	 Applications that allow the easy sharing of content-rich information, such as pictures and videos.
In the case of the JobPortal application, instead of finding friends, the user is trying to locate a temporary job in the vicinity, so she can work for a few hours and make some money. The premise is that employers looking for temporary/permanent help have entered available jobs, descriptions, hours, and offered wages in a web-based database that is accessible from Android mobile phones. Anyone looking for a few hours’ work can use the JobPortal application to access that database, look for jobs in the immediate area, communicate with friends about potential employers and potential jobs, and call the employer directly if she is interested in the position.
